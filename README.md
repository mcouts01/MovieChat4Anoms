## üöÄ Benchmark: MovieChat-1K 

To better evaluate the performance of MovieChat, we collect a new benchmark for long video understanding tasks, MovieChat-1K, which contains 1K high quality video clips sourced from various movies and TV series with 14K manual annotations.

To the best of our knowledge, a long video understanding dataset has not yet been established. Our work represents the initial step in creating and making it publicly available.We create MovieChat1K, containing 1k long
videos and corresponding 1k dense captions, and 13k visual question-answer pairs.For each video, we manually set and provide 1 dense caption for the whole video, 3 question-answering pairs for global mode and 10 question-answering pairs with timestamps for breakpoint mode. 

<p align="center" width="100%">
<a target="_blank"><img src="src/benchmark/dataset1.png" style="width: 100%; min-width: 200px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a>

We collect videos from 15 popular categories with varying distribution, including documentary film, detective film, animation film, and so on. Among these, each video comprises multiple alternating scenes, contributing to a diverse and dynamic visual narrative within the context of the collection. Over 90% of the videos exhibit a duration ranging from 10K to 12K frames, while 14.6% of videos extending beyond 12K frames. Only 8.6% of videos have duration less than 10k frames.


### Question-answering Pairs

#### Word Distribution
Note that MovieChat-1K is specifically designed for long video comprehension tasks, the majority of questions are open-ended, with only a quarter classified as multiple-choice questions, marked by initiators such as ‚ÄòDo,‚Äô ‚ÄòDoes,‚Äô ‚ÄòIs,‚Äô or ‚ÄòAre.‚Äô We also compute the word distributions of our provided
question-answer pairs, which includes common objects (people, clothes, etc.), time (day, night, etc.), scenes (indoor, outdoor, etc.), and so on.

<p align="center" width="100%">
<a target="_blank"><img src="src/benchmark/wordcloud.png" style="width: 40%; min-width: 200px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a>

#### Sentence length distribution
MovieChat1K exhibits diverse lengths of question-answer pairs in the segmented clip level. Despite the distribution of questionanswer pairs varies between the global mode and breakpoint mode, the majority of questions tends to concentrate between 5-15 words in length, while the length of answers generally have fewer than 10 words.

<p align="center" width="100%">
<a target="_blank"><img src="src/benchmark/length.png" style="width: 70%; min-width: 200px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a>

### Dense Captions

To facilitate a more detailed understanding of long videos, we provide
a dense caption for each video. MovieChat-1K exhibits diverse caption lengths in the segmented clip level. Approximately two-thirds of the clips
have captions with 100-149 words, while one-fifth of the
clip captions have fewer than 100 words. About 11% of
clips have long captions with more than 150 words.

<p align="center" width="100%">
<a target="_blank"><img src="src/benchmark/caption_dis.png" style="width: 40%; min-width: 200px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a>

To analyze the word distribution of our generated captions, we compute their distributions. The resulting word
distribution of the captions is presented in Fig. B6, which
includes common objects (man, woman, people, girl, etc.),
attributes (detective, various, small, white, etc.), locations
(inside, behind, south, next, etc.), scenes (room, house,
building, office, etc.), actions/events (talk, enter, leave, take,
etc.), and more.

<p align="center" width="100%">
<a target="_blank"><img src="src/benchmark/caption_wordcloud.png" style="width: 45%; min-width: 200px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a>

In terms of actionness, MovieChat-1K captions contains nearly the same number of verbs as with the WebVid10M dataset. To evaluate this, we use the NLTK toolkit to
analyze the number of verbs in captions, focusing on extracting and tagging all unique verbs. We find a total of
109,485 verbs in the WebVid10M caption dataset, while the
MovieChat-1K captions contain 102,988 unique instances
of verbs. While these counts may not be entirely accurate
due to our simple counting method, we believe they provide
a rough indication of the actionness of the two datasets.

<!-- ## Comparison between MovieChat-1K and other benchmarks

MovieChat-1K provides a large-scale benchmark
for long video understanding, which contains 1K movies,
1K dense captions and 13k question-answer pairs. The
comparison between different datasets are shown in Tab. 8.
It is evident that MovieChat-1K provides the longest
average duration for movie clips. MovieQA exclusively offers question-answer pairs related to movies,
while MovieGraphs supplies captions associated with
movies. Unlike other datasets, MovieNet encompasses
three main types of texts: subtitle, synopsis, and script,
excluding question-answer pairs. Additionally, the synopsis category is designed for the entire movie rather than
video clips. Consequently, MovieChat-1K is more suitable
for studying long video comprehension compared to other
datasets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Install 

### Environment Preparation

First, ceate a conda environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate moviechat
```

### Prerequisites

Before using the repository, make sure you have obtained the following checkpoints:

#### Pre-trained Language Decoder

- Get the original LLaMA weights in the Hugging Face format by following the instructions [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama).
- Download Vicuna delta weights :point_right: [[7B](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-delta-v0)] (Note: we use **v0 weights** instead of v1.1 weights). 
- Use the following command to add delta weights to the original LLaMA weights to obtain the Vicuna weights:

```
python apply_delta.py \
    --base ckpt/LLaMA/7B_hf \
    --target ckpt/Vicuna/7B \
    --delta ckpt/Vicuna/vicuna-7b-delta-v0 \
```

#### Pre-trained Visual Encoder for MovieChat
- Download the MiniGPT-4 model (trained linear layer) from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a4zLvaiDBr-36pasffmgpvH5P7CKmpze/view).

#### Download Pretrained Weights

- Download pretrained weights to run MovieChat with Vicuna-7B as language decoder locally from this [link](https://huggingface.co/DAMO-NLP-SG/Video-LLaMA-Series/resolve/main/finetune-vicuna7b-v2.pth).

## ü§ñ How to Run Demo Locally

Firstly, set the `llama_model`, `llama_proj_model` and `ckpt` in [eval_configs/MovieChat.yaml](./eval_configs/MovieChat.yaml).
Then run the script:
```
python inference.py \
    --cfg-path eval_configs/MovieChat.yaml \
    --gpu-id 0 \
    --num-beams 1 \
    --temperature 1.0 \
    --text-query "What is he doing?" \
    --video-path src/examples/Cooking_cake.mp4 \
    --fragment-video-path src/video_fragment/output.mp4 \
    --cur-min 1 \
    --cur-sec 1 \
    --middle-video 1 \
```
Note that, if you want to use the global mode (understanding and question-answering for the **whole** video), remember to change middle-video into 0.

<!-- ## üëç Main Results
### Short video question-answering
We use several widely
used open-ended datasets: MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, and ActivityNet-QA for short video question-answering tasks. The evaluation process is under the assistance of LLM with the default hyper-parameter settings. The accuracy and relative scores on a scale of 0 to 5 are reported. Compared to previous methods, MovieChat achieves comparable performance even it is not
specifically designed for short video question-answering tasks,
